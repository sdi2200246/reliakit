# Changelog

All notable changes to this workspace are documented here.

This project follows normal Rust crate versioning. Crate releases may use a
workspace tag such as `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or a crate-specific tag such as
`CRATE-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `reliakit-primitives`: added the `service_config` example, demonstrating
  `reliakit-primitives`, `reliakit-secret`, and `reliakit-validate` working
  together. The library's runtime dependencies remain zero; the secret and
  validate crates are dev-dependencies used only by the example.

### Changed

- Rewrote the workspace `README.md` with "Why Reliakit?", "When should I use
  this?", and a before/after section; corrected the workspace layout, status,
  and roadmap to reflect all published crates.

## reliakit-primitives 0.2.4 - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Release-automation and version-tagging verification. No functional or API
  changes from `0.2.3`.

## reliakit-primitives 0.2.3 - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Fixed silent `u64` truncation in `HumanDuration::parse` for very large hour
  values. Inputs such as `"18446744073709551615h"` previously returned `Ok`
  with a wrong `Duration`; they now return `Err(Invalid)`.
- Removed unreachable dead-code guard in `HumanDuration::parse`.
- Fixed potential `usize` overflow in `BoundedVec::push` error payload when
  `MAX == usize::MAX`.

## reliakit-validate 0.1.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added the `reliakit-validate` crate with:
  - `Validate` — trait for types that can validate themselves.
  - `Valid<T>` — zero-cost wrapper carrying proof of successful validation.
  - `ValidationError` — error type collecting one or more `Violation`s.
  - `Violation` — single failed constraint with optional field name.
  - `ValidateResult<T>` — `Result<T, ValidationError>` type alias.

## reliakit-collections 0.1.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added the `reliakit-collections` crate with:
  - `BoundedVec<T, MIN, MAX>` — owned `Vec<T>` constrained to hold between
    `MIN` and `MAX` elements. `push` and `pop` return errors instead of
    panicking when bounds would be violated.
  - `CollectionError` — error type with `TooFew`, `TooMany`, and
    `InvalidBounds` variants.

## reliakit-primitives 0.2.2 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added `FromStr` implementations for string-backed and parsed primitives:
  - `NonEmptyStr`
  - `BoundedStr<MIN, MAX>`
  - `Slug`
  - `Email`
  - `HttpUrl`
  - `HexString`
  - `SemVer`
  - `Uuid`
  - `HumanDuration`
- Added direct comparisons against `str`, `&str`, `String`, and `&String` for
  the same primitive types.

### Changed

- Enabled `missing_docs` warnings for `reliakit-primitives`.
- Made additional infallible or validation-only constructors `const fn` where
  supported by the current MSRV.

## reliakit-secret 0.1.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added the `reliakit-secret` crate with:
  - `Secret<T>`
  - `SecretString`
  - `ExposeSecret<T>`
  - `ExposeSecretMut<T>`
- Added a `secret_basic` example.

## reliakit-primitives 0.2.1 - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Polished the `reliakit-primitives` crate README for crates.io.
- Clarified the crate purpose: typed validated values for library APIs and input
  boundaries.
- Added examples for text primitives, structured values, and error handling.
- Moved the `primitives_basic` example into the crate package so it is included
  in published crates.io sources.

### Fixed

- Rejected empty email domain labels such as `user@example..com`.
- Fixed the root README Star History embed.

## reliakit-primitives 0.2.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added additional primitive types to `reliakit-primitives`:
  - `Slug`
  - `Email`
  - `HttpUrl`
  - `HexString`
  - `PercentageF64`
  - `PositiveInt`
  - `PositiveFloat`
  - `NonEmptyVec<T>`
  - `SemVer`
  - `Uuid`
  - `HumanDuration`
- Added Codecov configuration and per-crate coverage flagging for
  `reliakit-primitives`.

### Fixed

- Tightened validation for email whitespace, HTTP URL whitespace, SemVer
  identifiers, and human duration unit ordering.
- Fixed SemVer pre-release ordering and numeric identifier comparison.
- Rejected HTTP(S) URLs with missing hosts such as `https:///path`.

## reliakit-primitives 0.1.0 - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Initialized the Reliakit Rust workspace.
- Added `reliakit-primitives` with:
  - `NonEmptyStr`
  - `BoundedStr<MIN, MAX>`
  - `Percent`
  - `Port`
  - `ByteSize`
- Added CI, docs, coverage, audit, and publish dry-run workflows.

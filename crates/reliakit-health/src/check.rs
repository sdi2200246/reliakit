use crate::{Criticality, Health};

/// A single named health check, borrowing its strings.
///
/// `Check` is a small `Copy` value that pairs a component name with its
/// [`Health`], a [`Criticality`], and an optional detail message. It borrows its
/// `&str` fields, so it needs no allocation and works in `no_std` without
/// `alloc` — build a fixed array of `Check`s and hand them to [`aggregate`].
///
/// For a dynamically built, owned collection use
/// [`HealthReport`](crate::HealthReport) (requires `alloc`).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use reliakit_health::{aggregate, Check, Health};
///
/// let checks = [
///     Check::new("database", Health::Healthy),
///     Check::new("cache", Health::Unhealthy).optional().with_detail("primary down"),
/// ];
///
/// // The cache is optional, so its failure only degrades the service.
/// assert_eq!(aggregate(checks), Health::Degraded);
/// ```
/// `#[non_exhaustive]`: build a `Check` with [`Check::new`] and the builder
/// methods rather than a struct literal, so fields can be added later without

Clock-agnostic retry backoff policies for Rust.

`reliakit-backoff` computes *how long to wait* between retries. It does not
sleep, spawn tasks, or read the clock — you decide when to call it and how to
wait. That keeps it usable from synchronous code, any async runtime, and
`no_std` / embedded targets, with deterministic tests.

The crate has no dependencies, is `#![no_std]`, and forbids unsafe code.

## What This Crate Does

- `Backoff` — a small `Copy` policy: a base delay, a growth strategy (constant,
  linear, or exponential), an optional maximum delay, and an optional retry
  limit.
- `Backoff::delay(attempt)` — maps a zero-based attempt number to the delay to
  wait, or `None` once the retry limit is reached. All arithmetic saturates, so
  large attempt numbers never overflow, panic, or hang.
- `Backoff::delays()` — an iterator over successive delays.
- `full_jitter` / `equal_jitter` / `decorrelated_jitter` — pure jitter helpers
  that take a caller-supplied random value, so the crate stays dependency-free
  and the math stays testable.

## What This Crate Does Not Do

It does not sleep, retry for you, manage tasks, or own a random number
generator. It computes delays; you drive the loop and supply randomness. For an
opinionated executor, combine it with your runtime's timer.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit-backoff = "1.0"
```

This crate is `no_std` and has no feature flags; it depends only on `core`.

## Example

```rust
use core::time::Duration;
use reliakit_backoff::{full_jitter, Backoff};

let policy = Backoff::exponential(Duration::from_millis(100), 2)
    .with_max_delay(Duration::from_secs(2))
    .with_max_retries(5);

assert_eq!(policy.delay(0), Some(Duration::from_millis(100)));
assert_eq!(policy.delay(1), Some(Duration::from_millis(200)));
assert_eq!(policy.delay(5), None); // retry limit reached

// Drive your own loop; supply randomness for jitter from your RNG.
let rand = 0x1234_5678u32;
for base in policy.delays() {
    let wait = full_jitter(base, rand);
    // sleep(wait); if try_operation().is_ok() { break; }
    let _ = wait;
}
```

## Strategies

| Constructor | Delay for attempt `n` |
|---|---|
| `Backoff::constant(base)` | `base` |
| `Backoff::linear(base, step)` | `base + step * n` |
| `Backoff::exponential(base, factor)` | `base * factor^n` |

All are clamped to `with_max_delay(..)` and stop at `with_max_retries(..)`.
`factor` is an integer multiplier (e.g. `2` doubles each attempt).

## Jitter

| Function | Range |
|---|---|
| `full_jitter(delay, rand)` | `0 ..= delay` |
| `equal_jitter(delay, rand)` | `delay/2 ..= delay` |
| `decorrelated_jitter(base, prev, cap, rand)` | `base ..= prev*3`, capped at `cap` |

`rand` is interpreted as the fraction `rand / u32::MAX`. Source it from `rand`,
`getrandom`, or a hardware RNG.

## Feature Flags

This crate has no feature flags.

## `no_std`

`reliakit-backoff` is `#![no_std]` and allocation-free — it depends only on
`core`, with no third-party crates. All delay arithmetic saturates, so large
attempt numbers never overflow, panic, or hang.

## Safety

This crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and `#![no_std]`.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust `1.85` and newer. No nightly features are used.

## Status

Published to crates.io and pre-1.0. The API is small and stable; it may receive
backward-compatible refinements before a `1.0` release.

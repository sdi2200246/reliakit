One name for the whole **Reliakit** reliability toolkit — a zero-dependency,
`no_std`-friendly family of building blocks, each re-exported behind a feature
flag.

This crate contains no logic of its own. It exists so you can depend on a single
name and turn on only the pieces you need. Nothing is pulled in by default beyond
the `std` flag — each module appears only when its feature is enabled, so the
zero-dependency, `no_std`-friendly nature of each building block is preserved.

## What This Crate Does

- Gives the toolkit **one import name** instead of a dozen.
- Re-exports each building block as a module: `reliakit::ratelimit`,
  `reliakit::secret`, `reliakit::circuit`, and so on.
- Forwards `std`/`alloc` to whichever sub-crates you enable, so `no_std` works
  through the umbrella exactly as it does for the individual crates.

## Footprint

The umbrella adds nothing of its own, and neither do the building blocks:

- **Zero third-party dependencies** — even with `features = ["full"]`, the entire
  dependency tree is `reliakit-*` crates and the standard library. Nothing to
  vet, audit, or track for security advisories
  (`cargo tree -p reliakit --all-features` proves it).
- **No `unsafe`** — every crate declares `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- **`no_std`-friendly** — `alloc`/`std` are opt-in and forwarded per feature.
- **Pay only for what you enable** — each module compiles in only when its
  feature is turned on, so unused blocks cost nothing.

## When To Use It

- You want several Reliakit building blocks and prefer one dependency line and
  one version to track.
- You are exploring the toolkit and want everything reachable under one name
  (`features = ["full"]`).

## When Not To Use It

- You need exactly one building block and want the tightest possible dependency
  graph — depend on that crate directly (e.g. `reliakit-ratelimit`). The umbrella
  adds no capability, only convenience.

## Installation

Enable only the building blocks you need:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit = { version = "0.2", features = ["ratelimit", "secret"] }
```

```rust
use reliakit::ratelimit::RateLimiter;
use reliakit::secret::Secret;
```

`no_std` with `alloc`:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["alloc", "primitives"] }
```

Everything at once:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

## Examples

The building blocks are designed to compose, all reached through the one
`reliakit` name.

**A resilient client** — guard one call to a flaky dependency with an overall
deadline, rate limiting, a circuit breaker, and backoff, driven by a single clock:

```sh
cargo run -p reliakit --example resilient_client \
  --features "timeout ratelimit circuit backoff"
```

See [`examples/resilient_client.rs`](./examples/resilient_client.rs).

**A config check** — validate a service config from raw, untrusted strings,
reporting every problem at once with the credential kept out of logs:

```sh
cargo run -p reliakit --example config_check \
  --features "primitives validate secret"
```

See [`examples/config_check.rs`](./examples/config_check.rs).

**Typed JSON** — parse untrusted JSON strictly, then lift the raw fields into
validated primitive types:

```sh
cargo run -p reliakit --example typed_json --features "json primitives"
```

See [`examples/typed_json.rs`](./examples/typed_json.rs).

| `json` | `reliakit::json` | [`reliakit-json`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-json) — strict, bounded JSON |
| `derive` | `reliakit::derive` | [`reliakit-derive`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-derive) — derive macros |
| `decide` | `reliakit::decide` | [`reliakit-decide`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-decide) — utility decision engine |

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `std` | yes | Implies `alloc`; forwards `std` to enabled crates. |
| `alloc` | via `std` | Forwards `alloc` to enabled crates that need owned storage. |
| `core` | no | Adds `reliakit::core` and enables the clock-aware `*_now` methods of any enabled resilience crate. |
| `<crate>` | no | Adds that crate's module (see table above). |
| `full` | no | Enables every building block. |
| `json-canonical` | no | Enables `reliakit-json`'s RFC 8785 canonical serialization. |
| `json-primitives` | no | Typed JSON extraction into `reliakit-primitives`. |
| `json-validate` | no | Accumulating JSON field validation into `reliakit-validate`. |
| `codec-primitives` | no | Canonical codec impls for `reliakit-primitives` types. |

## `no_std`

`no_std`-compatible (`default-features = false`). Enable the umbrella's `alloc`
feature for the modules whose owned storage is gated behind it — `primitives`,
`secret`, `validate`, `collections`, `codec`, `csv`, and `health`. `json` and
`decide` always include `alloc` on their own, so they need no extra feature. The
pure-`core` blocks (`backoff`, `retry`, `bulkhead`, `circuit`, `ratelimit`,
`timeout`) need neither `std` nor `alloc`.

## Safety

`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The umbrella adds no code beyond re-exports; each
building block forbids unsafe code in its own right.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust `1.85` and newer. No nightly features are used.

## Status

Pre-1.0. A thin re-export layer over the `reliakit-*` building blocks; its public
surface is the set of feature flags, which may gain backward-compatible additions
before a 1.0 release.

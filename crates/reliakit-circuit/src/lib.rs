//! Clock-agnostic circuit breaker.
//!
//! A circuit breaker protects a caller from a failing dependency: once failures
//! pile up it "opens" and rejects calls immediately (failing fast) instead of
//! hammering a service that is already down, then periodically lets a trial call
//! through to test recovery.
//!
//! [`CircuitBreaker`] is a small, `Copy` state machine. It does **not** read the
//! clock, sleep, or allocate — you pass the current time in on each call as a
//! plain `u64` in whatever monotonic unit you choose (milliseconds is typical).
//! That keeps it usable from synchronous code, any async runtime, and `no_std`
//! / embedded targets, and makes its behavior fully deterministic in tests.
//!
//! # States
//!
//! ```text
//!            failures >= failure_threshold
//!   Closed ───────────────────────────────▶ Open
//!     ▲                                       │
//!     │ successes >= success_threshold        │ cooldown elapsed
//!     │                                       ▼
//!     └────────────── HalfOpen ◀──────────────┘
//!                        │
//!                        │ any failure
//!                        └──────────────▶ Open
//! ```
//!
//! - **Closed** — calls flow normally. Consecutive failures are counted; once
//!   they reach `failure_threshold` the breaker trips to **Open**.
//! - **Open** — calls are rejected immediately. After `cooldown` time units the
//!   next [`allow`](CircuitBreaker::allow) moves it to **HalfOpen**.
//! - **HalfOpen** — trial calls are allowed. `success_threshold` consecutive
//!   successes close the breaker; the first failure reopens it.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use reliakit_circuit::{CircuitBreaker, State};
//!
//! // Trip after 3 consecutive failures; stay open for 30_000 ms.
//! let mut cb = CircuitBreaker::new(3, 30_000);
//!
//! // A run of failures opens the breaker.
//! for _ in 0..3 {
//!     assert!(cb.allow(0));      // still Closed, calls allowed
//!     cb.on_failure(0);
//! }
//! assert_eq!(cb.state(), State::Open);
//! assert!(!cb.allow(1_000));     // rejected while Open (cooldown not elapsed)
//!
//! // After the cooldown, one trial call is allowed (HalfOpen).
//! assert!(cb.allow(31_000));
//! assert_eq!(cb.state(), State::HalfOpen);
//!
//! // A success closes it again.
//! cb.on_success();
//! assert_eq!(cb.state(), State::Closed);
//! ```
//!
//! # Counting failures by rate
//!
//! [`CircuitBreaker`] counts *consecutive* failures. For a *failure rate* over a
//! rolling window — "trip if N of the last M calls failed" — use
//! [`RollingBreaker`], a const-generic, inline (zero-allocation) variant.

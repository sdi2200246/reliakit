Reliakit is a workspace of small, focused crates for building reliable Rust
software — CLIs, services, bots, libraries, and infrastructure tools. The core
idea is simple: **validate and constrain data at the boundary, then carry the
trusted invariant deeper into your program** so the rest of the code cannot hold
an invalid state.

It is a general-purpose reliability toolkit. Validated primitives, secret
redaction, bounded collections, deterministic encoding, and runtime-agnostic
resilience utilities (retry backoff, circuit breaker, rate limiter, timeouts)
are useful in web backends, command-line tools, embedded code, data pipelines,
and protocol or blockchain work alike — none of those is the primary target.

Every crate is small, dependency-free at runtime (only the standard library and
other `reliakit-*` crates — a CI check fails the build if any third-party
dependency appears), `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and usable on its own. You adopt
**one crate at a time**, not a framework.

## Why Reliakit?

- **Validate once, at the boundary.** Construct a typed value where data enters
  your program (config, request, CLI, environment) and never re-check it again.
- **Make invalid states hard to represent.** A `Port` is always `1..=65535`; a
  `BoundedStr<3, 32>` always has 3–32 characters. The type signature documents
  and enforces the rule for you.
- **Stop leaking secrets.** Wrap sensitive values in `Secret<T>` / `SecretString`
  so they render as `[REDACTED]` in `Debug`, `Display`, logs, and error reports.
- **Bound your inputs and collections.** `BoundedVec<T, MIN, MAX>` cannot be
  built outside its size limits.
- **Encode data deterministically.** `reliakit-codec` (binary) and
  `reliakit-json` (text) produce the same bytes for the same value — handy for
  cache keys, fixtures, hashing, and signing.
- **Handle resilience explicitly.** Backoff, circuit breaking, rate limiting,
  and timeouts are plain values you pass the current time into — no runtime, no
  hidden threads, no global state.
- **Keep adoption cost low.** Small independent crates compile fast and pull in
  nothing extra.

| Decision logic | `reliakit-decide` | Deterministic utility-based decisions (`Reasoner` with `decide`/`explain`/`gate`/`Policy`) |

## Real-world use cases

### 1. Backend / API input validation

Validate request fields into typed values once, near the edge:

```rust
use reliakit_primitives::{Email, Port};

let contact = Email::new("ops@example.com")?;
let port = Port::new(8080)?;
assert_eq!(contact.domain(), "example.com");
assert_eq!(port.get(), 8080);
```

### 2. CLI tools / config parsing + secret-safe logging

Turn loosely-typed config into trusted types, and keep credentials out of logs:

```rust
use reliakit_primitives::{BoundedStr, Percent, Port};
use reliakit_secret::{ExposeSecret, SecretString};

type ServiceName = BoundedStr<3, 32>;

let name = ServiceName::new("api-service")?;
let success_rate = Percent::new(99)?;
let port = Port::new(8080)?;
let api_key = SecretString::from_string("rk_live_example");

assert_eq!(api_key.to_string(), "[REDACTED]"); // never leaks in Display/Debug/logs
assert_eq!(api_key.expose_secret(), "rk_live_example"); // explicit opt-in to read it
```

### 3. Microservices / external calls — rate limiting and circuit breaking

Clock-agnostic resilience values you drive with your own time source:

```rust
use reliakit_ratelimit::RateLimiter;
use reliakit_circuit::{CircuitBreaker, State};

// Allow bursts of up to 10, refilling 1 token every 100 ms (~10/sec).
let mut limiter = RateLimiter::new(10, 1, 100);
assert!(limiter.try_acquire_one(0));

// Trip after 3 consecutive failures; stay open for 30_000 ms.
let mut breaker = CircuitBreaker::new(3, 30_000);
for _ in 0..3 {
    let _ = breaker.allow(0);
    breaker.on_failure(0);
}
assert_eq!(breaker.state(), State::Open); // fail fast instead of hammering a down service
```

### 4. Data pipelines / bounded input handling

```rust
use reliakit_codec::{decode_from_slice_exact, encode_to_vec};
use reliakit_derive::{CanonicalDecode, CanonicalEncode};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, CanonicalEncode, CanonicalDecode)]
struct Record { id: u64, ok: bool }

let bytes = encode_to_vec(&Record { id: 7, ok: true })?;
assert_eq!(decode_from_slice_exact::<Record>(&bytes)?, Record { id: 7, ok: true });
```

### 5. Typed JSON for APIs and storage

```rust
use reliakit_derive::{JsonDecode, JsonEncode};
use reliakit_json::{from_json_str, to_json_string};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, JsonEncode, JsonDecode)]
struct Event { id: u64, name: String }

let json = to_json_string(&Event { id: 1, name: "deploy".into() });
assert_eq!(json, r#"{"id":1,"name":"deploy"}"#);
assert_eq!(from_json_str::<Event>(&json).unwrap(), Event { id: 1, name: "deploy".into() });
```

### 6. Embedded / `no_std`-friendly constraints

The resilience crates and the allocation-free primitives work without `std` or
even `alloc`. A `CircuitBreaker` or `RateLimiter` is a small `Copy` value with
saturating, panic-free integer math — you pass a `u64` tick in, so it runs on
embedded targets just as well as on a server.

### 7. Protocols and deterministic encoding (incl. blockchain)

Because `reliakit-codec` defines one canonical byte representation per type and
`reliakit-json` can emit RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical JSON (opt-in `canonical`
feature), the same value always produces the same bytes — useful for cache keys,
content addressing, and hashing or signing in protocol and blockchain work. This
is one use case among many, not the focus.

## Quick start / installation

The quickest way in is the umbrella crate `reliakit`, which re-exports every
building block behind a feature flag. Add one dependency and enable only the
pieces you want:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit = { version = "0.1", features = ["ratelimit", "secret"] }
```

```rust
use reliakit::ratelimit::RateLimiter;
use reliakit::secret::Secret;
```

Nothing is pulled in beyond the features you enable, so the zero-dependency,
`no_std`-friendly nature of each block is preserved. Use `features = ["full"]`
for everything.

Prefer the tightest possible dependency graph? The crates are fully independent —
depend on just the ones you need:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit-primitives  = "0.4"
reliakit-secret      = "0.1"
reliakit-validate    = "0.3"
reliakit-collections = "0.3"
reliakit-codec       = "0.2"
reliakit-json        = "0.2"
reliakit-backoff     = "0.1"
reliakit-bulkhead    = "0.1"
reliakit-circuit     = "0.2"
reliakit-ratelimit   = "0.1"
reliakit-timeout     = "0.1"
reliakit-core        = "0.1"
reliakit-derive      = "0.1"
reliakit-decide      = "0.1"
```

Each crate is independent — most projects use two or three. The minimum
supported Rust version is **1.85**.

The resilience crates (`backoff`, `bulkhead`, `circuit`, `ratelimit`, `timeout`)
are **clock-agnostic** — you pass the time in (where they need it), so they
compose and work in sync, async, and embedded code: a rate limiter decides
whether to call, a bulkhead bounds how many calls run at once, a circuit breaker
stops calling a failing dependency, backoff spaces out retries, and a timeout
bounds how long you wait.

## Design philosophy

- **Small, independent crates** you adopt one at a time — no framework lock-in.
- **Explicit invariants** validated at construction; invalid states are hard to
  represent.
- **Boring, predictable APIs** — plain types and traits, no hidden runtime,
  threads, or global state.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** (standard library + other `reliakit-*` crates
  only) and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` throughout.
- **Deterministic behavior** — same input, same output; saturating arithmetic in
  the resilience crates.
- **Feature-gated integrations** — cross-crate links (e.g. codec ↔ primitives,
  JSON ↔ validate) are opt-in features, never default.

## When to use Reliakit

- Validating config, CLI flags, environment, or request payloads at the boundary.
- Backend services, bots, and libraries that need small typed constraints.
- Keeping secrets out of logs and diagnostics.
- Deterministic encoding for cache keys, fixtures, protocols, or signing.
- Adding explicit retry/backoff/rate-limit/circuit-breaker/timeout logic without
  pulling in an async runtime.
- Embedded or `no_std` code that needs constrained values or resilience math.

## When not to use Reliakit

Reliakit is a set of small building blocks, not a platform. Reach for something
else when you need:

- a full web framework, HTTP stack, or async runtime integration;
- a complete serialization ecosystem with format plugins and zero-copy
  deserialization;
- schema validation, query/database tooling, or an ORM;
- domain-specific validators beyond Reliakit's intentionally narrow checks
  (its `Email`/`HttpUrl` validation is pragmatic, not a full RFC implementation).

## Feature flags & `no_std`

Reliakit is `no_std`-friendly where it makes sense, but the details differ per
crate — check each crate's README for the exact flags.

- **Default features** enable `std`, which implies `alloc`. Building with
  `--no-default-features` gives the `no_std` subset.
- **Allocation-backed APIs need `alloc`.** Owned types (`String`/`Vec`-backed,
  e.g. `Email`, `BoundedStr`, `SecretString`, `BoundedVec`, all of
  `reliakit-json`) require the `alloc` feature; the allocation-free primitives
  (`Port`, `Percent`, `Uuid`, `MacAddress`, `HumanDuration`, numeric types) work
  with neither.
- **The resilience crates are pure `core`.** `reliakit-backoff`,
  `reliakit-circuit`, `reliakit-ratelimit`, `reliakit-timeout`, and
  `reliakit-core` need no allocation at all. `circuit`, `ratelimit`, and
  `timeout` offer an optional `core` feature that adds `*_now(clock)` convenience
  methods.
- **`reliakit-derive` is a proc-macro crate.** It runs at compile time on the
  host, so the usual `no_std`/`alloc` discussion does not apply to it; the code
  it generates inherits the `no_std` support of the trait crate.

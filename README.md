# Reliakit

Small, zero-dependency Rust reliability crates: explicit invariants, redacted
secrets, bounded inputs, deterministic data, and runtime-agnostic resilience —
`no_std`-friendly, no `unsafe`, adopt one crate at a time.

Reliakit is a workspace of small, focused crates for building reliable Rust
software — CLIs, services, bots, libraries, and infrastructure tools. The core
idea is simple: **validate and constrain data at the boundary, then carry the
trusted invariant deeper into your program** so the rest of the code cannot hold
an invalid state.

It is a general-purpose reliability toolkit. Validated primitives, secret
redaction, bounded collections, deterministic encoding, and runtime-agnostic
resilience utilities (retry backoff, circuit breaker, rate limiter, timeouts)
are useful in web backends, command-line tools, embedded code, data pipelines,
and protocol or blockchain work alike — none of those is the primary target.

Every crate is small, dependency-free at runtime (only the standard library and
other `reliakit-*` crates — a CI check fails the build if any third-party
dependency appears), `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, and usable on its own. You adopt
**one crate at a time**, not a framework.

## Why Reliakit?

- **Validate once, at the boundary.** Construct a typed value where data enters
  your program (config, request, CLI, environment) and never re-check it again.
- **Make invalid states hard to represent.** A `Port` is always `1..=65535`; a
  `BoundedStr<3, 32>` always has 3–32 characters. The type signature documents
  and enforces the rule for you.
- **Stop leaking secrets.** Wrap sensitive values in `Secret<T>` / `SecretString`
  so they render as `[REDACTED]` in `Debug`, `Display`, logs, and error reports.
- **Bound your inputs and collections.** `BoundedVec<T, MIN, MAX>` cannot be
  built outside its size limits.
- **Encode data deterministically.** `reliakit-codec` (binary) and
  `reliakit-json` (text) produce the same bytes for the same value — handy for
  cache keys, fixtures, hashing, and signing.
- **Handle resilience explicitly.** Backoff, circuit breaking, rate limiting,
  and timeouts are plain values you pass the current time into — no runtime, no
  hidden threads, no global state.
- **Keep adoption cost low.** Small independent crates compile fast and pull in
  nothing extra.
- **One cohesive family — take one or all.** Use a single crate for one job, or
  the `reliakit` umbrella for several; every block follows the same conventions
  and the same zero-dependency, `no_std`, no-`unsafe` rules. Reliability patterns
  usually mean stitching together unrelated crates with different designs and
  dependency trees — here they are built to fit.

## Footprint

Adding Reliakit is close to free — the costs you usually weigh before taking on a
dependency mostly aren't here:

- **Zero third-party dependencies.** With every feature enabled, the entire
  dependency tree is `reliakit-*` crates and the standard library — nothing else
  to vet, audit, or track for security advisories. A CI check fails the build if
  a third-party crate ever appears, and `cargo tree -p reliakit --all-features`
  proves it.
- **No `unsafe`.** Every crate declares `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- **`no_std`-friendly.** The core crates build for bare metal (for example
  `thumbv7em-none-eabi`); `alloc` and `std` are opt-in features.
- **Fast cold builds.** There is no third-party graph to compile — you build
  Reliakit and nothing else.
- **Small, readable surface.** Each crate does one thing and is small enough to
  read end to end before you depend on it.
- **Pay only for what you use.** Take a single crate, or pull several through the
  `reliakit` umbrella behind per-crate feature flags.

## Core features

| Area | Crate(s) | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Validated primitives | `reliakit-primitives` | `Port`, `Email`, `HttpUrl`, `Hostname`, `BoundedStr`, `Percent`, `SemVer`, `Uuid`, `HumanDuration`, … |
| Secret redaction | `reliakit-secret` | `Secret<T>`, `SecretString`, opt-in `expose_secret` |
| Validation traits | `reliakit-validate` | `Validate` trait, `ValidationError` that collects every field violation |
| Bounded collections | `reliakit-collections` | `BoundedVec<T, MIN, MAX>` with enforced size invariants |
| Canonical binary codec | `reliakit-codec` | `CanonicalEncode` / `CanonicalDecode`, strict decoding |
| Strict JSON | `reliakit-json` | Strict parser + limits, deterministic output, typed `JsonEncode` / `JsonDecode` |
| Strict CSV | `reliakit-csv` | Strict, bounded reader + deterministic writer, typed `CsvEncode` / `CsvDecode` |
| Resilience | `reliakit-backoff`, `reliakit-bulkhead`, `reliakit-circuit`, `reliakit-ratelimit`, `reliakit-timeout` | Retry backoff, concurrency limiter, circuit breaker, token-bucket rate limiter, deadlines — all clock-agnostic |
| Retry helper | `reliakit-retry` | `RetryPolicy` + `retry` / `retry_with_sleep` / `retry_async`; runtime-agnostic, never sleeps internally |
| Health reporting | `reliakit-health` | `Health` status + criticality-aware aggregator for `/health`, probes, and status pages |
| Shared clock | `reliakit-core` | `Clock` trait + `ManualClock` / `MonotonicClock` |
| Derive helpers | `reliakit-derive` | `#[derive(CanonicalEncode, CanonicalDecode, JsonEncode, JsonDecode)]` |
| Decision logic | `reliakit-decide` | Deterministic utility-based decisions (`Reasoner` with `decide`/`explain`/`gate`/`Policy`) |

## Which resilience block do I use?

The resilience crates each solve one problem, and each is a plain value you drive
with the current time — no runtime, no hidden threads, no global state. Pick by the
question you are asking:

| Question | Block | Crate |
|---|---|---|
| How long should I wait between retries? | backoff delays + jitter | [`reliakit-backoff`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-backoff) |
| Retry a fallible call with an attempt limit? | retry driver (sync + async) | [`reliakit-retry`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-retry) |
| Stop calling a dependency that keeps failing? | circuit breaker | [`reliakit-circuit`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-circuit) |
| Cap how *often* something may happen? | token-bucket rate limiter | [`reliakit-ratelimit`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-ratelimit) |
| Cap how *many* run at once, and shed the rest? | concurrency limiter (bulkhead) | [`reliakit-bulkhead`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-bulkhead) |
| Has the time budget for this operation run out? | deadline / timeout | [`reliakit-timeout`](https://crates.io/crates/reliakit-timeout) |

They compose rather than overlap: `retry` drives `backoff` between attempts;
`circuit` stops calling a dependency once it has failed enough; `ratelimit` and
`bulkhead` shed load before you start (too often / too many at once); and `timeout`
bounds the whole operation. None of them sleep or spawn for you — you pass the
clock (or a sleeper) in, so they stay runtime-agnostic and trivial to test.

The [`resilient_client`](crates/reliakit/examples/resilient_client.rs) example shows
a timeout, a rate limiter, a circuit breaker, and retry-with-backoff cooperating in
a single call.

## Real-world use cases

### 1. Backend / API input validation

Validate request fields into typed values once, near the edge:

```rust
use reliakit_primitives::{Email, Port};

let contact = Email::new("ops@example.com")?;
let port = Port::new(8080)?;
assert_eq!(contact.domain(), "example.com");
assert_eq!(port.get(), 8080);
```

### 2. CLI tools / config parsing + secret-safe logging

Turn loosely-typed config into trusted types, and keep credentials out of logs:

```rust
use reliakit_primitives::{BoundedStr, Percent, Port};
use reliakit_secret::{ExposeSecret, SecretString};

type ServiceName = BoundedStr<3, 32>;

let name = ServiceName::new("api-service")?;
let success_rate = Percent::new(99)?;
let port = Port::new(8080)?;
let api_key = SecretString::from_string("rk_live_example");

assert_eq!(api_key.to_string(), "[REDACTED]"); // never leaks in Display/Debug/logs
assert_eq!(api_key.expose_secret(), "rk_live_example"); // explicit opt-in to read it
```

### 3. Microservices / external calls — rate limiting and circuit breaking

Clock-agnostic resilience values you drive with your own time source:

```rust
use reliakit_ratelimit::RateLimiter;
use reliakit_circuit::{CircuitBreaker, State};

// Allow bursts of up to 10, refilling 1 token every 100 ms (~10/sec).
let mut limiter = RateLimiter::new(10, 1, 100);
assert!(limiter.try_acquire_one(0));

// Trip after 3 consecutive failures; stay open for 30_000 ms.
let mut breaker = CircuitBreaker::new(3, 30_000);
for _ in 0..3 {
    let _ = breaker.allow(0);
    breaker.on_failure(0);
}
assert_eq!(breaker.state(), State::Open); // fail fast instead of hammering a down service
```

### 4. Data pipelines / bounded input handling

```rust
use reliakit_codec::{decode_from_slice_exact, encode_to_vec};
use reliakit_derive::{CanonicalDecode, CanonicalEncode};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, CanonicalEncode, CanonicalDecode)]
struct Record { id: u64, ok: bool }

let bytes = encode_to_vec(&Record { id: 7, ok: true })?;
assert_eq!(decode_from_slice_exact::<Record>(&bytes)?, Record { id: 7, ok: true });
```

### 5. Typed JSON for APIs and storage

```rust
use reliakit_derive::{JsonDecode, JsonEncode};
use reliakit_json::{from_json_str, to_json_string};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, JsonEncode, JsonDecode)]
struct Event { id: u64, name: String }

let json = to_json_string(&Event { id: 1, name: "deploy".into() });
assert_eq!(json, r#"{"id":1,"name":"deploy"}"#);
assert_eq!(from_json_str::<Event>(&json).unwrap(), Event { id: 1, name: "deploy".into() });
```

### 6. Embedded / `no_std`-friendly constraints

The resilience crates and the allocation-free primitives work without `std` or
even `alloc`. A `CircuitBreaker` or `RateLimiter` is a small `Copy` value with
saturating, panic-free integer math — you pass a `u64` tick in, so it runs on
embedded targets just as well as on a server.

### 7. Protocols and deterministic encoding (incl. blockchain)

Because `reliakit-codec` defines one canonical byte representation per type and
`reliakit-json` can emit RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical JSON (opt-in `canonical`
feature), the same value always produces the same bytes — useful for cache keys,
content addressing, and hashing or signing in protocol and blockchain work. This
is one use case among many, not the focus.

### 8. Health and readiness endpoints / status pages

`reliakit-health` turns per-component status into one answer for a `/health` or
`/readyz` endpoint or a status page. You build a `HealthReport` from `critical`
and `optional` checks, and the aggregate is criticality-aware: an `optional`
dependency (say a cache) being `Unhealthy` degrades the service rather than
failing it, while a `critical` one (the database) fails it. It only reports — it
never retries, sleeps, or acts.

### 9. Graded, explainable decisions (routing, selection, agents)

`reliakit-decide` is a small deterministic decision engine for when an `if`/`else`
is too blunt. A `Reasoner` scores candidate `Action`s from weighted
`Consideration`s shaped by a `Curve`, with `gate(...)` for hard constraints (an
option that is down or rate-limited is skipped entirely) and `explain()` for why
a choice won — useful for request routing, picking a backend, or deciding when an
agent should call an LLM. Same inputs, same decision, every time.

## Quick start / installation

The quickest way in is the umbrella crate `reliakit`, which re-exports every
building block behind a feature flag. Add one dependency and enable only the
pieces you want:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit = { version = "1.0", features = ["ratelimit", "secret"] }
```

```rust
use reliakit::ratelimit::RateLimiter;
use reliakit::secret::Secret;
```

Nothing is pulled in beyond the features you enable, so the zero-dependency,
`no_std`-friendly nature of each block is preserved. Use `features = ["full"]`
for everything.

Prefer the tightest possible dependency graph? The crates are fully independent —
depend on just the ones you need:

```toml
[dependencies]
reliakit-primitives  = "1.0"
reliakit-secret      = "1.0"
reliakit-validate    = "1.0"
reliakit-collections = "1.0"
reliakit-codec       = "1.0"
reliakit-json        = "1.0"
reliakit-csv         = "1.0"
reliakit-backoff     = "1.0"
reliakit-retry       = "1.0"
reliakit-bulkhead    = "1.0"
reliakit-health      = "1.0"
reliakit-circuit     = "1.0"
reliakit-ratelimit   = "1.0"
reliakit-timeout     = "1.0"
reliakit-core        = "1.0"
reliakit-derive      = "1.0"
reliakit-decide      = "1.0"
```

Each crate is independent — most projects use two or three. The minimum
supported Rust version is **1.85**.

The resilience crates (`backoff`, `bulkhead`, `circuit`, `ratelimit`, `timeout`)
are **clock-agnostic** — you pass the time in (where they need it), so they
compose and work in sync, async, and embedded code: a rate limiter decides
whether to call, a bulkhead bounds how many calls run at once, a circuit breaker
stops calling a failing dependency, backoff spaces out retries, and a timeout
bounds how long you wait.

## Design philosophy

- **Small, independent crates** you adopt one at a time — no framework lock-in.
- **Explicit invariants** validated at construction; invalid states are hard to
  represent.
- **Boring, predictable APIs** — plain types and traits, no hidden runtime,
  threads, or global state.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** (standard library + other `reliakit-*` crates
  only) and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` throughout.
- **Deterministic behavior** — same input, same output; saturating arithmetic in
  the resilience crates.
- **Feature-gated integrations** — cross-crate links (e.g. codec ↔ primitives,
  JSON ↔ validate) are opt-in features, never default.

## When to use Reliakit

- Validating config, CLI flags, environment, or request payloads at the boundary.
- Backend services, bots, and libraries that need small typed constraints.
- Keeping secrets out of logs and diagnostics.
- Deterministic encoding for cache keys, fixtures, protocols, or signing.
- Adding explicit retry/backoff/rate-limit/circuit-breaker/timeout logic without
  pulling in an async runtime.
- Embedded or `no_std` code that needs constrained values or resilience math.

## When not to use Reliakit

Reliakit is a set of small building blocks, not a platform. Reach for something
else when you need:

- a full web framework, HTTP stack, or async runtime integration;
- a complete serialization ecosystem with format plugins and zero-copy
  deserialization;
- schema validation, query/database tooling, or an ORM;
- domain-specific validators beyond Reliakit's intentionally narrow checks
  (its `Email`/`HttpUrl` validation is pragmatic, not a full RFC implementation).

## Feature flags & `no_std`

Reliakit is `no_std`-friendly where it makes sense, but the details differ per
crate — check each crate's README for the exact flags.

- **Default features** enable `std`, which implies `alloc`. Building with
  `--no-default-features` gives the `no_std` subset.
- **Allocation-backed APIs need `alloc`.** Owned types (`String`/`Vec`-backed,
  e.g. `Email`, `BoundedStr`, `SecretString`, `BoundedVec`, all of
  `reliakit-json` and `reliakit-csv`) require the `alloc` feature; the
  allocation-free primitives
  (`Port`, `Percent`, `Uuid`, `MacAddress`, `HumanDuration`, numeric types) work
  with neither.
- **The resilience crates are pure `core`.** `reliakit-backoff`,
  `reliakit-retry`, `reliakit-circuit`, `reliakit-ratelimit`, `reliakit-timeout`,
  and `reliakit-core` need no allocation at all. `circuit`, `ratelimit`, and
  `timeout` offer an optional `core` feature that adds `*_now(clock)` convenience
  methods. `reliakit-retry` never sleeps or spawns; the caller injects any
  waiting, so it forces no async runtime.
- **`reliakit-derive` is a proc-macro crate.** It runs at compile time on the
  host, so the usual `no_std`/`alloc` discussion does not apply to it; the code
  it generates inherits the `no_std` support of the trait crate.

## Minimum supported Rust version

The MSRV is **Rust 1.85**, declared as `rust-version` on every crate and checked
in CI on each change (the build is compiled with 1.85, not just the latest
stable). No nightly or unstable features are used.

Raising the MSRV is treated as a **breaking change**: it ships with a version
bump (a minor bump while a crate is pre-1.0, a major bump once it is 1.0) and is
noted in the changelog — it is never raised silently in a patch release. So
pinning a crate version keeps it building on the Rust it shipped with.

## Contributing
